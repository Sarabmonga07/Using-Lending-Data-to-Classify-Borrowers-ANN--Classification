# Using-Kaggle-s-Lending-Data-to-Classify-Borrowers-ANN--Classification
Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), we will build a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan. This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan
